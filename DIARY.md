For my initial stage of development, I will create a Game Design Document (GDD),
That will serve as a blueprint for the development team and helps ensure everyone involved has a clear understanding of the project.
My GDD will include: Game Overview, Story and Setting, Gameplay Machanics, Level Design, Characters and Enemies, and User Interface (UI).

I will be writting my GDD while simultaneously woring on the inital phase of the game, that is importing the assets.
And more importantly start preparing right away. 
Having a idea of what the game will look like, I will proceed with creating nodes as this engine accommodates developere if there were a change in vision, like moving from a 2-D game to a 3-D one.
For this projet, I will be developing 2-D game for the sake of a first time developer.

As for the GDD, I will make a word documnet and store it in the Documnets Folder with the Project Plan.
, while importhing the gaming assets from open source websites.
I will make notes on new information I read, tasks I preformed, and where I will be needing to go.


Imprted the assets.

I may seen like I have imported too much, though there are two reasons for that:
	1) Some pacakes include a varity of textures, characters, and objects to use, thus there'll be more options for decorating the levels when constructing the Nodes and the Scenes{I'll explain later}.
	2) If there are assets that I end up not using, I'll probaly remove them.
	
The assets are from open source websites whare are as follows:
	1) https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-top-down
	2) https://opengameart.org/

In Godot, a node is a fundamental building block with a specific function (e.g., Sprite, Audio, Script) that represents an element of game logic or behavior.
A scene is a collection of nodes arranged in a tree hierarchy, allowing complex objects or environments to be created and reused throughout the game.
This structure promotes modularity and simplifies the development process
